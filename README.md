Here are three examples, but the possibilities are endless: 
1. I’m hungry now. Could you recommend some restaurants within a 5-minute walking distance?

2. If I want to try some Indian dishes, what would you recommend me to eat?

3. Today, I’d like to try some pasta or pizza. Which restaurant would you recommend?
